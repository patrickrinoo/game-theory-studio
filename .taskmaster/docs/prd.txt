# Monte Carlo Simulation for Game Theory PRD

## 1. Introduction:
### Project Overview
**Monte Carlo Simulation for Game Theory** is a web-based application designed to provide users with a detailed understanding of **game theory** through Monte Carlo simulations. Game theory is a mathematical framework used to analyze competitive situations where the outcome depends on the actions of multiple participants. The app will simulate different **game-theoretical scenarios** and calculate the best strategies for players based on **probabilistic outcomes** using the Monte Carlo method.

The goal is to make **game theory** concepts, such as **Nash equilibrium**, **prisoner's dilemma**, and **mixed strategies**, more accessible and interactive. The app will run simulations to demonstrate how players can make optimal decisions based on varying strategies, uncertainties, and interactions in competitive environments.

This tool is designed to help students, educators, and researchers better understand the mathematical principles behind **game theory** and their real-world applications in economics, politics, business, and artificial intelligence.

## 2. Objective & Goals

- **Simulate Game Theory Scenarios**: Allow users to input game-theoretic scenarios (e.g., **Prisoner's Dilemma**, **Chicken Game**, **Stag Hunt**, etc.) and simulate different strategies.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Use the **Monte Carlo method** to run simulations and determine the probability of each player's success based on their strategies.
- **Educational Tool**: Provide an interactive and visual experience to help users understand complex **game theory concepts** and how they apply to decision-making in real-world scenarios.
- **Strategy Optimization**: Help users determine **optimal strategies** (Nash equilibrium or mixed strategies) by simulating multiple iterations and analyzing results.
